				<h3>Example #1</h3>
				<p>I'm new to this, so I don't have a ton of examples just yet, but I'm getting there! This is my first fully responsive, static site, and I am very proud of it! This is a picture of my bootstrap carousel (the first picture in my carousel anyway). </p>

				<h3>Example #2</h3>
        <p>My about page was an exercise in layout.  I had a lot of interesting relationships between the individual boxes before I figured out uniform margin and padding settings.  This page was also the most fun to make responsive because it enabled me to use several different breakpoints. I've since simplified the layout and decreased the breakpoints to make the page more readable.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-9">
      	<h3>Example #3</h3>
				<p>My contact section introduced bootstrap glyphicons (the little icons in black before my actual contact info).  The trick for this was to make my columns line up both full screen and at different breakpoints.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-9">
      	<h3>Example #4</h3>
				<p>This one was a particularly difficult idea to implement, mostly because there is a ton of code that goes into an accordion and it is very simple to make a mistake that will cause it not to work.  Luckily, I was able to get it and style it the way I want (which also took some time to figure out!).</p>
